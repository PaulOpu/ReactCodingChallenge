## Handler

This section includes every kind of helper functions and constants for the working of the app. Some of the constants (e.g. the API_URL) are just located here for the demonstration of the project, but would be provided from outside in a real project.

## Client

This section contains the connections to APIs. At the moment there is only one file (api.js) there, but it can be easily split by the functionalities.
